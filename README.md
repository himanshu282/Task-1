# Task-1
This is a task assigned to me in which I have to make an android application. 

### Description

The language used here is **Kotlin** 
I have called an Api which contains an arraylist of images,authors, id, etc using **Retrofit2** and showed them in a recycler view. I have also done *Pagination* without using any third party library which helped me to achieve endless scrolling. This project is done using the architecture pattern *MVVVM(Model-View-ViewModel). For fetching image from API , I have used **coil** which is a image loading library. On clicking the image of a particular row in recycler view, the id of that image is being sent to the second activity. 
I faced few issues while implementing pagination as nowadays we use **paging 3 library** but i have implemented it without it
You can read about all the things mentioned above in android official website to have a good knowledge of them 


### How to install and run the project
To run this project you should have an IDE which support kotlin like **android studio**
Just clone all the files of the project in your system using git commands or ssh link and you can run the project either in your android device or system emulator whichever is convenient.
